# Week2-homework

## Description

A portfolio with my previous work
My name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me

UI scrolls to the corresponding section when clicked on link in header

When presented with my first application
THEN that application's image is larger in size than the others

There are no other applications yet, therefore placeholder images have been placed for these

When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
then you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport
